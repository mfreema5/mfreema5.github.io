          I'm interested in the (mis)use of multiple regression analysis in academic papers, so I took PSYC 380 ‘Advanced Statistics – Applied Correlation and Regression’ at IIT.  Since it was an undergraduate level course, the credit hours I earned from it can't be applied toward my Master's degree, but I still think it was worth the time as I learned quite a lot about properly applying various regression and correlation methods.

          For my final project for PSYC 380, I did an analysis of data based on a hypothesis developed by Miaja Renko, Assistant Professor of Management Studies, University of Illinois-Chicago.  The data came from the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Development II (PSED-II)  I employed a response-surface analysis technique [shanock ref], and the results were promising enough that I've done some more work to refine the analysis for a research article she is writing.
