      I'm a graduate student in the IIT Master's program for Technical Communication and Information Design.
      </p>
      <p>
      My background is not particularly complicated, but it is convoluted.
      </p>
      <p>
      I studied chemistry for my undergraduate degree.  Along the way I took enough math and English courses to get minors in both of them.  Years later I returned to school and studied journalism.  I earned a Writing Certificate in Journalism from the University of Cincinnati.

      In between those two educational interludes, I worked in the compressed gas industry.  First at a plant that produced and/or packaged gases for the semiconductor industry—exotic things like silane, diborane, and Halocarbon-116.  The second plant I was at warehoused those semiconductor-industry gases, but dealt more with standard industrial gases, such as argon, carbon dioxide, oxygen, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
      After I finished studying journalism in Cincinnati, I went back into the compressed gas industry, at a plant that was expanding into high-purity and custom-mixed “specialty” gases.  The firm as a whole was far from a being a start-up, but the specialty gases part of it was something of a start up.
      </p>
      <p>
      Engaging in the discovery and creation that is an integral part of every start-up was very fun.  But eventually we had discovered and created enough that the start-up had become a functioning business entity, and the focus shifted to maintenance and restrained growth.
      </p>
      <p>
      And so now I am a graduate student.  My ambition is to continue to find projects that involve discovery and creation.
