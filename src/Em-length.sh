#
#  Usage:
#        ./Em-length [string]
#
#  Calculates the “em-length” of a string.
#  The em-length is how long a line of text will be
#  based on the characters in it.
#  This is how newspaper headlines were composed/sized
#  in the days before computerators.
#
#  Note on math weirdness:
#    BASH only does integer math.
#    Paper-space ems are width measures.
#    Display-space ems are height measures.
#  Thus: ems are doubled to make them all integers.
#  But they are divided by three to account for the
#  height-vs-width discrepancy.
